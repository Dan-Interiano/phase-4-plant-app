# Plants and Plants

## Description

This app is for those plant enthusiasts looking for some info on their favorite plants, and how to care for them.

## Usage

A User signs up for an account on the website using their own username and password, which creates a record on our backend database. That information is saved in our sesssions, and a user is then logged in where they will be able to view a list of plants that are being fetched to from our database. Each plant comes with an array of information about each plant, from how to care for each specific plant to reviews that other users have left. Users can also delete and edit a review. Users may also adopt a plant for their own personal collection of plants. 

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

## Roadmap
For the future we plan to add features to the "My Garden" component that include being able change the picture of a plant that they've adopted. They will also be able to add a 'nickname' to their plant as well. 
A log can be kept for each plant as well, to keep track of a specific plants progress. A log will reamin private for each user to see. There will also be a forum added, where users can discuss amongst themselves socially.
